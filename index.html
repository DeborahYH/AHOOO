                    <p>Welcome to AHOOOs, a place where you can learn all about horns, antlers, and similar structures!</p>
                    <p>Since I am currently learning HTML, CSS and Javascript, I decided to create this website as a small
                        project to help me practice.</p>
                    <p>Here, you'll not only find information about the anatomy, physiology, and evolution of horns and antlers but also their uses, significance, and interesting facts about how humans have utilized them throughout history. Iâ€™m also planning to add a store and some small games in the near future, so stay tuned!</p>
                    <p>Since this is a small project that I have been developing just for practice and enjoyment, this website might look
                       a bit chaotic right now. However, I still hope it can showcase my skills as I continue to learn and improve.</p>

                <h2>Horns</h2>
                <p>Permanent structures that do not branch, and consist of a core made of live bone covered by a
                    keratinized sheath. They are found in members of the Bovidae family, and their size and shape can
                    differ between species.</p>

                <h2>Antlers</h2>
                <p>Branched structures found in members of the Cervidae family which can be shed each year and are
                    composed of different types of tissues. While antlers can be found on female reindeer, these
                    structures are usually found on males.</p>
