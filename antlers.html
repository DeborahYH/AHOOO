            <p>Antlers are branched structures found in members of the family Cervidae, and are made of bony outgrowths with no keratin sheath. Apart from female reindeer and caribou, antlers are only found on males <sup>[4, 14]</sup>.</p> 
            <p>The antlers consist of a shaft that grows upwards, as well as tines that branch out. Both become longer as the animal grows older, and new tines develop over time as well <sup>[12]</sup>.</p>                 
        </section>

        <section class="content">
            <h2>Development</h2>
            <p>Before the animal reaches sexual maturity, a pair of bony protrusions called pedicles starts to develop in response to testosterone in male deer. After puberty, the antlers start growing from the pedicles <sup>[12]</sup>.</p>    
            <p>Antlers are not permanent, and their growth and shedding - which occur every year - are controlled by both hormonal changes and environmental cues <sup>[7, 12]</sup>. Antlers grow from spring until mating season, and during this period the antler is called "wet antler", due to the fact that it is covered by velvet <sup>[4, 12]</sup>. The velvet is highly vascularized and contains mesenchymal stem cells which contribute to antler osteogenesis. These characteristics facilitate the rapid growth of the antler <sup>[12]</sup>.</p> 
            <p>There are two mechanism involved in antlerogenesis <sup>[6, 12]</sup>:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Endochondral Ossification: Occurs in the upper parts of the antler, in a region containing mesenchymal stem cells which generates highly vascularized cartilaginous tissue. The rich blood supply allows rapid longitudinal growth, while the chondrocytes are eventually substituted with osteoblasts, eventually leading to the fomation of osteons and lamellar bone.</li>
                <li>Intramembranous Ossification: Occurs in the  lower part of the antler, under the velvet, and contributes to increases in diameter.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Once the antlers reach maturity, testosterone levels increase, leading to the interruption of blood flow in the velvet, resulting in its death and revealing the bone ("dry antler"). This leaves the hard antlers that are used during breeding season. Later, once the rut is over and testosterone level decrease, osteoclasts cause the bone to be reabsorbed in the area between the pedicle and the antler's base, causing it to shed in the winter <sup>[4, 7, 12, 14]</sup>.</p>
            <p>Overall, antler growth in influenced mostly by genetics (which affects the antler's shape, composition and size), age and nutrition. However, the mother's condition can also affect the development of these structures <sup>[7]</sup>.</p>

            <h2>Structure</h2>
                <p>The structure of the antler contains a main shaft or beam which grows upwards, and smaller tines which branch into a forked shape. Both the shaft and tines become longer with age, and additional tines are also added <sup>[11, 12, 13]</sup>.</p>
                <p>The first (primary) antlers are simple, unbranched structures. Later, they split into two halves, which may grow further. However, the anterior half usually has the lower growth potential, causing it to develop into a tine. The posterior half, on the other hand, can grow further until it bifurcates again. However, in species belonging to the Mazama and Pudu genera, or the Elaphodus species, the adults have only spikes <sup>[8]</sup>.</p>
                <p>When evaluating a cross-section of an antler, it is possible to see that the outer regions (compact bone) are denser than the middle, which has a porous structure (cancellous bone). These characteristics give the antler its mechanical properties, including bending strength and impact resistance <sup>[13]</sup>.</p>
                <p>It is also worth noting that, while antlers contain a relatively small amount of mineral content, they possess high levels of type I collagen, which results in antlers being less stiff than cortical bone but at the same time gives this structure low-yield strength <sup>[13]</sup></p>

            <h2>Function</h2>
            <p>Antlers can be used as weapons in combat between males during breeding season to obtain access to females <sup>[12]</sup>. During this process, male deer lock antlers and push each other to determine which one is stronger <sup>[7]</sup>.</p>
            <p>The first phase consists in the initial clash, which requires a high resistance to impact. During the second phase, both deer lock antlers and then start pushing and twisting in an attempt to break the opponent's balance and inflict injuries. During this phase, the antler's resistance to torsional forces becomes important. During a fight, the tines provide both a protective effect andfirm contact between the males, allowing effective transmission of force <sup>[8]</sup>.</p>
            <p>They can also indicate health and genetic quality to potential mates through their appearance, size and sturdiness. Some researchers also believe antlers can be used as a defense against predators <sup>[7, 12]</sup>. During the wet antler phase, the vascular network in the velvet may also contribute for thermoregulation <sup>[12]</sup>.</p>

            <h2>Cool Facts Fast Facts</h2>

            <p><b>Reindeer</b></p>    
            <p>Reindeer are unusual among cervids in that both males and females have antlers. Their growth and development are influenced by changes in hormone levels (testosterone in males, oestradiol in females), changes in body mass and insulin-like growth factor levels.</p>
            <p>Their antlers, however, still differ in size. This probably relates to the function theses structures serve for each gender. While males use their antlers mostly for combat and lose them in the autumn, female reindeer maintain their antlers for a longer period, using them for foraging and when competing over food resources during winter. Since their antlers are smaller and less costly, female reindeer can still conserve energy and resources for pregnancy and calving <sup>[12]</sup>.</p>

            <p><b>Water Deer (Hydropotes inermis)</b></p>    
            <p>Unlike most cervids, water deer lack antlers. Instead, both sexes have developed canine teeth, which in  males form long curved tusks. These can be used for display or as weapons during fighting and — while they rarely result in death — injuries caused by these teeth can stil leave painful and dangerous wounds. While these tusks  have led to them being called "vampire deer" in certain areas, these animals still possess a vegetarian diet like their antlered counterparts <sup>[2, 9, 15]</sup>.</p>

            <p><b>Growth Speed</b></p>    
            <p>Antlers have a fast growth rate, which can average 2-4 cm per day. This means these structures require a considerable amount of nutrients during their growth phase <sup>[13]</sup>. However, diet is not enough to supply all the minerals and proteins at an adequate rate. The solution is to use up minerals contained in the skeleton, which in turn can cause the animals to suffer from transient physiological osteoporosis <sup>[10, 12]</sup>.</p>

            <p><b>The Effect of Climate</b></p>    
            <p>Climate can affect plant availability and its composition, which can impact nutrition. This, in turn, can affect the length of antler's spikes. While this may be the main effect of climate on the development of antlers, other factors may also influence this process, such as variations in parasite abundance and insect activity, as well as the effects of extreme wind in winter <sup>[10]</sup>.</p>

            <p><b>Deformed Antlers</b></p>    
            <p>Some animals have a genetic predisposition to develop abnormally branched antlers, but different types of injuries can also result in temporary or permanent deformations <sup>[7]</sup>.</p> 
            <p>Injuries to the pedicle, which often occur as a result of fighting or accidents, can cause deformations for several years if they are severe <sup>[7]</sup>.</p>
            <p>Deformations may also occur during the stage when the antlers are covered by velvet, a period when they are more vulnerable. Injuries during this stage can result in deformations of the hard antler. If the injury is severe, it can result in the loss of parts of the antler as well as infections <sup>[7]</sup>.</p>
            <p>Lesions damaging the testicles, which disturbs hormone production, may also result in perruque or cactus antlers. The disrupment of the hormonal cycle allows the velvet keep growing, covering the animal's eyes. Trauma to the velvet can lead to infection, reducing fitness and eventually resulting in death. The formation of perruque antlers have been observed in roe deer, red deer, white-tailed deer, moose, and reindeer <sup>[17]</sup>.</p>
            <p>Curiously, leg injuries — which are often caused by vehicle-related accidents — can also contribute to the development of deformed antlers. The mechanism involved in this phenomenon are not completely understood, but may be related to the reallocation of nutrients towards the site of injury to promote healing, rather than towards antler growth <sup>[7]</sup>.</p>

            <p><b>Consumption by Other Animals</b></p> 
            <p>Shed antlers are an important source of nutrients such as calcium, phosphorus and protein, which are important for animal growth and can only be obtained in small quantities from plant sources. Raccoons, opossums, bears, foxes, coyotes, and even other deer have been observed gnawing on antlers to obtain its nutrients. Rodents will also gnaw on them to wear down their constantly growning teeth. Due to their role in nutrient recycling, hunting for shed antlers is illegal in many places <sup>[1, 5, 7]</sup>.</p>

            <p><b>Hearing in Mooses</b></p>    
            <p>Based on the importance of vocal communication for reproduction between moose, some researchers have proposed that their palmated antlers could aid in finding a partner in the large areas they occupy. These researchers suggest that those antlers could serve as a parabolic reflector capable of amplifying incoming sounds <sup>[3, 16]</sup>.</p>
            <p>To test this hypothesis, a study was conducted in 2008, where realistic artificial moose ears equipped with a sound recorder were tested in three positions:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Frontward: ears toward the incoming sound</li>
                <li>Sideward: ears toward the center of the antler's palm</li>
                <li>Backwards: ears aligned with the position of the neck</li>
            </ul> 
            <p>The results showed that the highest average sound pressure level was recorded when the ear was placed sideward, suggesting that antlers may amplify sounds. This, in turn, could help these animals find a mate during the reproductive season <sup>[3]</sup>.</p>

            <p><b>Medical Research</b></p>    
            <p>Antler growth and regeneration have become the focus of some research in recent years due to a paradox they present: despite their rapid growth rate, the incidance of cancer in cervids is relatively low when compared to other mammals. Additionally, although there are similarities between the cell proliferation programs of antlers and those responsible for cancer growth, antler tissue regeneration remains a highly coordinated physiological process. One possible mechanism that may explain this phenomenon is the regulation by certain tumour suppressor genes which are positively selected in cervids and highly expressed in antlers <sup>[6]</sup>.</p>
            <p>Studies on antler regeneration may also be valuable for the development of regenerative medicine. Antler stem cells, in particular, have potential applications in bone research and osteoporosis management. However, to date, no clinical trials have been performed, and the scarcity of robust studies remains an obstacle. The use of antler stem cells could also pose risks such as immune rejection, incorrect physiological functioning in the human body, and other safety hazards <sup>[6]</sup>.</p>
