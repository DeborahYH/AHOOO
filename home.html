                    <p>Welcome to Fancy Headpieces, a place for all things related to horns and antlers!</p>
                    <p>I am currently learning HTML, CSS and Javascript, so I decided to create this website as a small
                        project to help me practice. I have always tought that animals with horns or antlers look very elegant and
                        dignified, so this site will be something like a virtual temple for them.</p>
                    <p>Here, you will not only to find information about the anatomy, physiology and evolution of these
                        structures, but also their uses and importance, both for the animals who carry them and also for humans. I
                        will also include sections containing interesting facts about these headpieces, as well as other animals
                        who have similar structures</p>
                    <p>As a small project that I plan to develop for learning, practice and fun, this website will
                        probably look a bit chaotic, since I plan to test different things over the course of its development. Still, I
                        hope it can showcase my habilities as I learn and improve them.</p>

                <h2>Horns</h2>
                <p>Permanent structures that do not branch, and consist of a core made of live bone covered by a
                    keratinized sheath. They are found in members of the Bovidae family, and their size and shape can
                    differ between species.</p>

                <h2>Antlers</h2>
                <p>Branched structures found in members of the Cervidae family which can be shed each year and are
                    composed of different types of tissues. While antlers can be found on female reindeer, these
                    structures are usually found on males.</p>
