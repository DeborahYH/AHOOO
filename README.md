This is a simple website created for me to practice HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, with a primary focus on the anatomy and physiology of horns, antlers, and similar structures. Future updates will include a store and animal-related games, which I plan to develop using JavaScript.


## 1. Tools

- **HTML:** used for creating the structure of the webpages .
- **CSS:** used for designing and styling the webpages.
- **Javascript:** used for creating interactive games.


## 2. To-Do

- **1.** Add more information to the remaining pages
- **2.** Develop a few animal-related games using Javascript 
- **3.** Include a small store where people can buy merch related to the animals discussed on the website
